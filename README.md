# nwca-wetland-remote-sensing

- The main python notebook is stored here: **[nwca.ipynb](nwca.ipynb)**. 
  - Recommended: To edit, open the preview in Github, choose "Open in Colab", and then choose "Copy to Drive" to create an editable copy in your Google Drive (commit changes back to Github using *File > Save a Copy in Github*).
  - Or, download and run in a local installation. Use Python 3.8 via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) (I like to create a [custom environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with all packages included and edit via [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Python/Jupyter extensions. Clone the entire repo to get the dependencies too.

- **[results spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cgHMtexu1Uh0PdQA6xBZvblt_GbM2BdgyvNz1eSafYE/edit)** - this includes formatted versions of the model summary, OLS output tables, and $R^2$ tables

- **[draft writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fnhmbt6zaID3S4YoMtCJB1C3foWlZLN2QxGAfcuh9MA/edit)**

- **[google drive folder of dependencies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qX2B-0vQ80p6FfCZjPfWP6QH0K6lr0sr)** - this is where dependencies are pulled from if you are running in Google Colab.
